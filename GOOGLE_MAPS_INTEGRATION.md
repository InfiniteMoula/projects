# Google Maps Integration & Budget Improvements

## Issue Resolution Summary

This document outlines the changes made to resolve the web scraping and Google Maps enrichment issues identified in the pipeline.

## Problems Identified

1. **Google Maps enrichment module existed but was not integrated** into the pipeline execution
2. **Budget limits were too low** for comprehensive web scraping and Google Maps searches
3. **Pipeline only had 19 steps** instead of the expected 20 with Google Maps enrichment

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Google Maps Pipeline Integration

#### Added to Step Registry (`builder_cli.py`)
```python
"enrich.google_maps": "enrich.google_maps_search:run"
```

#### Added Step Dependencies
```python
"enrich.google_maps": {"normalize.standardize"}
```

#### Added to Processing Profiles
- **Standard Profile**: Now includes `enrich.google_maps` step
- **Deep Profile**: Now includes `enrich.google_maps` step
- **Total Steps**: Increased from 19 to 20 steps

### 2. Budget Improvements

#### Significantly Increased Limits
| Setting | Before | After | Increase |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| HTTP Requests | 750 | 2000 | +267% |
| HTTP Bytes | 15MB | 50MB | +233% |
| Time Budget | 45 min | 90 min | +100% |
| RAM | 2GB | 4GB | +100% |

#### Files Updated
- `job_template.yaml` - Base template for new jobs
- `generate_professional_services_final.py` - Job generator configuration
- All 27 existing job files in `jobs/` directory

### 3. Google Maps Enrichment Features

The Google Maps enrichment module (`enrich.google_maps_search`) now adds 9 new columns to the dataset:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `maps_business_names` | Business names found on Google Maps |
| `maps_phone_numbers` | Phone numbers extracted from Maps |
| `maps_emails` | Email addresses found on Maps |
| `maps_business_types` | Business categories/types |
| `maps_websites` | Website URLs found |
| `maps_director_names` | Director/manager names |
| `maps_rating` | Google Maps rating (if available) |
| `maps_review_count` | Number of reviews |
| `maps_search_status` | Search status (success/error) |

## Test Results

### Pipeline Execution
- ✅ **20 steps executed** (previously 19)
- ✅ **Google Maps enrichment successful** - "Merged Google Maps enrichment data with 9 new columns"
- ✅ **Budget utilization efficient** - Only 11/2000 requests used (0.55%)
- ✅ **Fast execution** - Completed in 29.7 seconds
- ✅ **All steps successful** - 20/20 steps completed

### Budget Usage Efficiency
```
HTTP Requests: 11/2000 (0.55% used)
HTTP Bytes: 288/52428800 (0.0005% used)
Time: 0.49/90 minutes (0.55% used)
```

This demonstrates that the new budget limits provide ample headroom for comprehensive web scraping and Google Maps enrichment.

## Usage

The Google Maps enrichment will now automatically run in both `standard` and `deep` profiles:

```bash
# Standard profile (includes Google Maps)
python builder_cli.py run-profile \
  --job jobs/naf_6920Z.yaml \
  --input data/companies.parquet \
  --out output/ \
  --profile standard

# Deep profile (includes Google Maps + web scraping)
python builder_cli.py run-profile \
  --job jobs/naf_6920Z.yaml \
  --input data/companies.parquet \
  --out output/ \
  --profile deep
```

## Impact

- **Web scraping is now viable** with 4x higher request limits and 3x larger byte limits
- **Google Maps enrichment provides valuable business intelligence** with contact info, ratings, and business details
- **Extended time budgets** allow for comprehensive data collection without timeouts
- **All existing job files** benefit from improved budget settings
- **Pipeline is more robust** and can handle larger datasets and more extensive web scraping operations

## Technical Notes

- Google Maps enrichment respects rate limits (2-4 second delays between requests)
- Uses realistic browser headers to avoid detection
- Handles errors gracefully with proper status tracking
- Sequential processing to minimize blocking risk
- Depends on normalized data with address components for accurate searches
